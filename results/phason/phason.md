I take a 20x20 *periodic* system, and fix 

$y_{up} = \frac{2}{1+\sqrt{5}}(x - 1) + 3 $

and $y_{down} = \frac{2}{1+\sqrt{5}}(x - 1) + 1 $

The elements in the list are `1, 21, 22, 23, 42, 43, 44, 45, 63, 64, 65, 66, 85, 86, 87, 88, 106,
107, 108, 109, 110, 128, 129, 130, 131, 150, 151, 152, 153, 171, 172,
173, 174, 193, 194, 195, 196, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 236, 237, 238,
239, 258, 259, 260, 279, 280`

Fix $m = 1.5$. The energies are,

And the probability density of the highest occupied orbital is,

# After introducing Phason only at site 175

The energies are almost unchanged.

## Result: 
Wherever a phason is introduced, the 
density of the highest occupied state 
at that point decreases. 

But this does not happen for other states.

Also, the density profile is very different for the
 lowest unoccupied state and the highest occupied state.
